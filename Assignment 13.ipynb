    "Ques 1.) What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "Excel spreadsheets offer several advantages over CSV (Comma-Separated Values) spreadsheets. Here are some key advantages of \n",
    "Excel :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Formatting and Styling : Excel allows us to apply formatting options such as bold, italics, font styles, colors, and cell \n",
    "    borders. We can also use conditional formatting to highlight specific values based on certain criteria. This formatting \n",
    "    capability makes it easier to present data in a visually appealing and organized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Formulas and Functions : Excel provides a wide range of built-in formulas and functions that allow us to perform complex \n",
    "    calculations and automate tasks. We can use functions for mathematical operations, statistical analysis, data manipulation,\n",
    "    and much more. These functionalities are not available in a plain CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Charts and Graphs : Excel offers a variety of chart types and graphing options to visualize data in a meaningful way. We \n",
    "    can create bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and many other types of charts to better understand patterns,\n",
    "    trends, and relationships within our data. This visual representation can make data analysis easier and more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Multiple Sheets and Workbooks : Excel allows us to have multiple sheets within a single workbook, and we can link and \n",
    "    reference data between sheets. This feature is helpful when dealing with complex data sets or organizing data into different\n",
    "    categories. Additionally, we can create multiple workbooks and use features like formulas and macros to consolidate and \n",
    "    analyze data from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) Data Validation : Excel provides data validation tools that allow us to define rules and restrictions for data entry. We\n",
    "    can set up dropdown lists, apply data type restrictions, and create custom validation rules to ensure data accuracy and \n",
    "    consistency. This helps prevent errors and maintains data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.) Collaboration and Sharing : Excel supports collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on the same spreadsheet\n",
    "    simultaneously. We can track changes made by different users, leave comments, and protect sensitive data with passwords or\n",
    "    file-level permissions. Excel also provides options for sharing spreadsheets via email or cloud storage platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.) Macros and Automation : Excel supports macros, which are recorded or programmed actions that automate repetitive tasks. We\n",
    "    can record a series of steps and replay them later to save time and effort. Macros can be used for data cleaning, \n",
    "    formatting, calculations, and other tasks, making Excel a powerful tool for automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While CSV files have their own advantages, such as simplicity and compatibility with various software applications, Excel \n",
    "provides a broader range of features and capabilities for data analysis, presentation, and automation."

    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "To create reader and writer objects in the csv module, we need to pass a file object as an argument. Here's how we can create\n",

    "\n",
    "1.) Creating a reader object :\n",
    "    \n",
    "To read data from a CSV file, we can create a reader object using csv.reader() and pass a file object as the parameter. The\n",

    "\n",
    "2.) Creating a writer object :\n",
    "    \n",
    "To write data to a CSV file, we can create a writer object using csv.writer() and pass a file object as the parameter. Here's\n",
